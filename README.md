# DDS - Project 1 - Budweiser EDA

Our goal was to perform an EDA by identifying errors and recognizing patterns that are present in the beers and breweries data sets given to us by Budweiser. Much of the work consisted of creating visual aids to show insights from the data. We addressed the relationship between alcohol content and the bitterness using multiple plots and methods. We also utilized a k-NN model to address the relationship between ALE and IPA. As a result this EDA shows how some of the most important components of beer relate to each other.

Based on our visualizations and insights, we concluded that there does appear to be evidence of a slightly positive relationship between IBU and ABV.
